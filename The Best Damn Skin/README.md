# The Best Damn Skin
Inspired by the color scheme of Avril Lavinge's [best selling album](https://www.discogs.com/release/1207293-Avril-Lavigne-The-Best-Damn-Thing)
(yes, it's true) this skin is "the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen!"

## Install
Installation is simple - [right click here](https://github.com/jerelhenderson/boombooms/blob/master/The%20Best%20Damn%20Skin/TBDS_source.xml) and save the file in your `..\MusicBee\Skins` folder.

## View
MusicBee (as much as possible) is able effectively mimic the process of carefully selecting a vinyl record or compact disc
from a bookshelf full of one's wonderful collection of music.

*Details* rule the world of a jazz enthusiast. Organizing tracks by their recording date, as opposed to release date, is impossible
with physical media, but can be handled excellently by MusicBee.

Likewise, the process of drilling down the organization of classical music to the each owned collection of a composer's work - rather 
than than by the prescribed medium order - makes MusicBee the premier music manager.

Splitting out music that don't use the Latin alphabet increases efficiency when scrolling through a myriad list of one's favorite 
artists and albums.
